## Lesson - 1 [Russian Basics]

First off, the word _Russian language_ in Russian language itself is called _русский язык_ (sounds / transliteration : russkiy yazyk). Let's begin from introducing ourselves in Russian.

### Introducing ourselves in Russian

Just like in English, there are literally many ways to introduce ourselves. In the same way, there are many ways to introduce ourselves. But, we will learn only the basics. Below are listed the terms in Russian that means __hello__.

* __Здравствуйте__ : (transliteration : zdrastvuyte, the first "в" is silent here) This term is the formal way of saying hello. But, we can use anywhere, like talking to a teacher, or to your company's boss, etc. Just say _Здравствуйте_.

* __Привет__ : (transliteration : privet/priv-yet) This term is also a way for saying hello in Russian, and you can use anywhere ranging from formal speech to informal speech. We can say this version of hello to our teacher as well as to our homies (neighbourhood friends). It basically means "Hii". People often tend to use this short version of hello. We can see this in various places, and even in youtube videos, the Russians use this word only instead of Здравствуйте.

* __хай__ : (transliteration : hay) This term also means "hii" and it sounds "hay" which is closer to the word "hii" for some extent. People tend to use this word very less than the others.

So, summarizing of what we read upto here. _Привет_ is the hello word that you should use and it is the mostly used term, but we also keep the word "_Здравствуйте_" also in your mind, as we also will use this word in many situations.

Now, lets proceed to introduce ourselves.
* Way - 1 : __Привет, Я Ришав__. This sentence translates to "Hii, I am Rishav. And, you guys know that "_Привет_" means hii. The word "_Я_" (sounds : ya) means "I". Next comes the interesting word, and that is my name _Ришав_..LOL! it says Rishav. Now, let's break the meaning of the line. Firstly, we say hello. Then we directly say I am --. The sentence on direct translation means "Hii, I Rishav". In Russian, we often tend to say like this. Take another example, like "I am a doctor" => "Я доктор" (sounds "ya doktor"). So, when the word _Я_ gets attached with another noun / word behind it, the meaning of it changes from just "I" to "I am". The same we can do with _Здравствуйте_, just by replacing the word _Привет_.
