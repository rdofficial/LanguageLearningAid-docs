# Language Learning Aid [docs]

This repository contains some of the docs for people to learn different languages spoken around the world. If you are interested in learning a new language, you can check out the docs inside this repo. The languages that are included in this repo are the ones that I (Rishav Das) know and understand.

## Languages known by the author
Below are listed all the languages known by the author (either just speaking, or just writting or both) :
* English (speaking + writting)
* Hindi (speaking + writting)
* Bengali (speaking only)
* Urdu (speaking + writting)
* Russian (basic speaking + writting)
* Persian (speaking + writting)
* Turkish (speaking + writting)

__Note__ : 
* The term _speaking_ does not means fluency that of a native speaker of that language, but it means that I can somehow talk in that language and people who know that particular language can still understand me and also understand what I am saying.
* The term _writting_ includes both writting from hands (+ keyboard typing), as well as reading from the written texts. i.e., if a language is marked with writting, it means I can write it that language and also understand about what is written in that language.
